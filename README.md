# RaspberryPi.HomeSecurity

## Description
This project attempts to use a RaspberryPi, a motion sensor, and a camera to record movement that is triggered by the motion sensor. The idea behind this project is to capture a photographic evidence of intruderes that are found in an off limits area.

Whenever some motion is detected by the PIR motion sensor, it triggers the camera to start recording a video clip (for 10-30 seconds). After that, an email is sent to the client to notify him/her of a potential intruder in a restricted area.
